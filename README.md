**MyJournal**
The MyJournal App is an application designed to help users write down information, organize their ideas, design their own avatar, and compete in challenges with their friends through a ranking system.

In designing the MyJournal interface, our primary objectives were to enhance learnability, usability, flexibility, and robustness.

We aimed for users to utilize the app as they would any standard note-taking and journaling application, while also incorporating engaging features to boost productivity. MyJournal provides personalized prompts, tracking, and resources to help you in your daily life.

The app features

- **Journal Prompts** â€“ Guided prompts tailored to help you write.
- **Mood Tracking** â€“ Set your mood with one tap and let your friends know how you are feeling!
- **Friend Code System** â€“ Share your journal journey with friends by exchanging friend codes!
- **Challenges/Leaderboard** - Complete challenges and earn points to work your way up in a ranking system.
- **Multi-language Support** â€“ Built-in support for English and Spanish.
- **Monthly Entry Filtering** â€“ Easily review your entries by month and stay consistent in your habits!
- **Privacy** â€“ Your journal is yours and myJournal uses encrypted storage with Firestore.
- **Error Prevention** - Our app ensures that users don't run into problems or make mistakes and are warned with alerts.

## Developement Resources:

This is a React Native (Expo) application, written in the TypeScript programming language. The app uses Firebase as for auth and storing data. The i18n-js library is used to manage languages.

The [Build Instructions](./docs/build.md) are a good place to get started with the app itself.

- Change any support links (feedback, email, terms of service, etc) to your own systems.
- Replace any analytics or error-collection systems with your own so we don't get super confused.
